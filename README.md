# Four in a Row - JavaScript Game
This project, is an Object-Oriented JavaScript Practice challenge from Treehouse. The project builds a fun and interactive 'Four in a Row' game, which can be played within your browser. A link to the original Treehouse Challenge can be found [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-challenge).

This is one of the many repositories I'll be creating whilst taking part in the Treehouse 100 Days of Code Challenge. I'm taking part in this challenge to improve my skills in areas I already work in a daily basis (PHP, JavaScript), revisit some old languages from my University days (Java, C++), as well as learning some new languages along the way (Python, GO).

## Stage 1 - Introducing 'Four in a Row'
In this stage, you'll get familiar with the game of 'Four in a Row' and you'll plan out how you want to organize your code.
- Use starter files to investigate the HTML and CSS
- Create the necessary classes for a game of Four in a Row
